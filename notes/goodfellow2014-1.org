#+TITLE: Notes on: Goodfellow, I.~J., Pouget-Abadie, J., Mirza, M., Xu, B., Warde-Farley, D., Ozair, S., Courville}, A., Bengio, Y., ... (2014): Generative Adversarial Networks

* First Pass

  The authors proposed a framework to train generative model, the
  generative adversarial network.

* Second Pass

  - We train discriminator to maximize the probability of assigning
    the correct label to both training examples and samples from
    generator.
  - We train generator to minimize the probability discriminator gets
    right, \(\log(1 - D(G(z)))\).
  - During the early phases, generator is poor, so they train
    generator to /maximize/ \(log(D(G(z)))\).


  How to evaluate generative model?
