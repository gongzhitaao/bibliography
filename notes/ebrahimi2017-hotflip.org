#+TITLE: Notes on: Ebrahimi, J., Rao, A., Lowd, D., & Dou, D. (2017): HotFlip: White-Box Adversarial Examples for NLP

* Gist

white-box attack

Model: char-CNN, highway layer, LSTM, and softmax output cite:kim2015-character.

Instead of embedding vectors, the authors use *one-hot* encoded characters to
represent words.

Flip at character level and word level.  Character-level flip is much more
successful.

* Comments

For translation, the decrease in BLEU is too small.
