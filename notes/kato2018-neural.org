** Problem

Using neural network to render 3d mesh into 2d image.  The convention technique,
rasterization, is non-differentiable.

Applications:
1. single-image 3D mesh reconstruction with silhouette image supervision, and
2. gradient-based 3D mesh editing with 2D supervision, e.g., 3D version of style

** Evaluation

*** Datasets

- ShapeNetCore cite:chang2015-shapenet compared with cite:yan2016-perspective

*** Metrics

- Reconstruction accuracy by voxel IoU (higher is better)

** Method

3D formats:
1. voxels
2. point cloud
3. polygon mesh
