#+TITLE: Notes on: Zhuang, C., Yan, S., Nayebi, A., Schrimpf, M., Frank, M., DiCarlo, J., & Yamins, D. (2020): Unsupervised neural network models of the ventral visual stream

* Gist

These results suggest that deep contrastive embedding objectives may be a
biologically-plausible computational theory of primate visual development.

These results suggest that semi-supervised learning methods may capture a
feature of real visual learning that builds on, but goes beyond,
task-independent self-supervision.

Goal-driven deep learning theory of visual cortex

It is interesting to note that the *neural predictivity* of the best unsupervised
method only slightly surpasses that of supervised categorization models.
Moreover, the detailed pattern of neural predictivities across units of the best
unsupervised models also generally aligns with that of the supervised models
