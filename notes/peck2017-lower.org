#+TITLE: Notes on: Peck, J., Roels, J., Goossens, B., & Saeys, Y. (2017): Lower bounds on the robustness to adversarial perturbations

* Gist

In this work, we derive lower bounds on the robustness of neural networks
directly in terms of their model parameters.  We consider only feedforward
networks comprised of convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully-connected
layers and softmax layers.
