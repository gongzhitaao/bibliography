#+TITLE: Notes on: Shayer, O., Levi, D., & Fetaya, E. (2018): Learning discrete weights using the local reparameterization trick

* Gist

** Problem

Quantize network, binary or ternary.

** Evaluation

*** Datasets

- MNIST
- CIFAR-10
- ImageNet

*** Metrics

- Accuracy

** Method

The +1/-1 or +1/0/-1 can be seen as the result from a multinomial distribution.
We learn the parameters for the distribution.  The weights in the resulting
network are sampled from the distributions, respectively.
