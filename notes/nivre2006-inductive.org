#+TITLE: Notes on: Nivre, J. (2006): Inductive dependency parsing

* First Pass

  The author wanted to find out whether inductive machine learning may
  help a deterministic parser for unrestricted natural language text.

  The author observes a significant improvement over the baseline,
  which uses a table without contextual information.

* Second Pass

  - dependency parsing
  - shift-reduce for context-free grammar
  - guided parsing.  A mapping from parser state to transitions.
