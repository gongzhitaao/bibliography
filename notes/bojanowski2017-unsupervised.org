#+TITLE: Notes on: Bojanowski, P., & Joulin, A. (2017): Unsupervised Learning By Predicting Noise

* Gist

deep unsupervised learning

self-supervision, these approaches are domain dependent since they
require explicit derivation of weak supervision directly from the
input.

Their approach, noise as target (NAT), learns discriminative features
in an unsupervised way.
