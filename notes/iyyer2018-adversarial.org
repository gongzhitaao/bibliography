#+TITLE: Notes on: Iyyer, M., Wieting, J., Gimpel, K., & Zettlemoyer, L. (2018): Adversarial Example Generation With Syntactically Controlled Paraphrase Networks

* Gist

** Problem

Main goal: Paraphrase with desired/controlled syntactic structure.
Side product: adversarial sentences by varying syntactic structure.

** Evaluation

*** Datasets

- ParaNMT-50M cite:wieting2017-pushing
- Stanford Sentiment Tree-bank (SST) cite:socher2013-recursive
- SICK entailment detection cite:marelli2014-semeval

*** Metrics

- human evaluation

** Method

- The paraphrasing data is generated via
  back-translation cite:wieting2017-pushing.
- A Parser cite:manning2014-stanford is used to get the syntax structure.
- First two level of the syntax tree is used as the template to generate via
  LSTM the complete syntax tree.
- The syntactic structure is encoded via LSTM into a fixed dimension vector,
  which is fed into the decoder, along with other decoder inputs, i.e.,
  ground-truth of previous word and attention-weighted previous state.

* Note

Paraphrasing is naturally difficult for the network to recognize.
