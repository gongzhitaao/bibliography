#+TITLE: Notes on: Esser, S. K., Appuswamy, R., Merolla, P., Arthur, J. V., & Modha, D. S. (2015): Backpropagation for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing

* First Pass

  The authors propose training spiking neural network using
  backpropagation by restricting weights and input to [0,1] which are
  interpreted as probabilities of spikes.  Tested on TrueNorth, the
  author obtained state-of-the-art benchmarks on MNIST.
