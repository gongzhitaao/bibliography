#+TITLE: Notes on: Xu, C., Yao, J., Lin, Z., Ou, W., Cao, Y., Wang, Z., & Zha, H. (2018): Alternating multi-bit quantization for recurrent neural networks

* Gist

** Problem

Quantize the network after training.

** Evaluation

*** Datasets

- Penn Tree Bank (PTB) cite:marcus1993-building
- WikiText-2 cite:merity2016-pointer
- Text8 [[mikolov2014-learning]]

*** Metrics

- Perplexity per word (PPW)

** Method

Seems like an iterative version of cite:guo2017-network.  Iteratively refine the
code book.
