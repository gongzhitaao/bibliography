#+TITLE: Notes on: Zhao}, Z., Dua, D., & Singh, S. (2017): Generating Natural Adversarial Examples

* Gist

** Problem

Generate adversarial examples in a transformed space.

** Evaluation

*** Datasets

- MNIST
- Church image in LSUN cite:yu2015-lsun
- Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) cite:bowman2015-large

*** Metrics

- Accuracy for classifiers, entailment models
- Dropping gerund for NMT system.

** Method

x \(\to\) Inverter \(\to\) z \(\to\) Generator \(\to\) \(x^\prime\) \(\to\)
model \(\to\) y

- Use encoder-decoder to find a dense low-dimension space \(z\) for the input
- Randomly sample in \(z\)
- Map back to the input space by generator to filter out unsuccessful
  adversarial samples.
