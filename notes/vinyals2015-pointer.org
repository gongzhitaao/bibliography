#+TITLE: Notes on: Vinyals, O., Fortunato, M., & Jaitly, N. (2015): Pointer Networks

* Summary

  We introduce a new neural architecture to learn the conditional
  probability of an output sequence with elements that are discrete
  tokens corresponding to positions in an input sequence.

* Problem

  Using /pointer network/, they give approximate solutions to
  1. finding planar convex hulls,
  2. computing Delaunay triangulations, and
  3. the planar Travelling Salesman Problem
