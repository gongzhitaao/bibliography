#+TITLE: Notes on: Courbariaux, M., David, J., & Bengio, Y. (2014): Training Deep Neural Networks With Low Precision Multiplications

* First Pass

  The authors showed that full precision for parameter updates
  combined with low precision for propagation can achieved competing
  result with full precision network.
