#+TITLE: Notes on: Liang, B., Li, H., Su, M., Li, X., Shi, W., & Wang, X. (2017): Detecting adversarial examples in deep networks with adaptive noise reduction

* Gist

1. Use /scalar quantization/ and /smoothing spatial filter/ to alter adversarial
   images
2. Detect adversarial images by comparing the classification results of a given
   sample and its denoised version.

The clean images are robust to those two denoising techniques, which most
adversarial images are not.
