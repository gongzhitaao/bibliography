#+TITLE: Notes on: Gong, Y., Liu, L., Yang, M., & Bourdev, L. (2014): Compressing Deep Convolutional Networks Using Vector Quantization

* First Pass

  The authors compress CNN with vector quantization.

* Second Pass

  Compressing CNNs for computer vision tasks.

  information theoretical /vector quantization/ methods
  1. Take the sign of weights, 1 if \(w \geq 0\), -1 otherwise.  And
     turn off neuron when it is negative.
  2. Use \(k\)-means to cluster weights.
  3. Divide matrix \(W\) column-wise, \(k\)-mean each submatrix.
  4. Residue quantization, i.e., first quantize the vectors into \(k\)
     centers and then to recursively quantize the residuals.
