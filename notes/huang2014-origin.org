#+TITLE: Notes on: Huang, H., & Kabashima, Y. (2014): Origin of the computational hardness for learning with binary synapses

* First Pass

  The authors analyze the weight space of binary perceptron from the
  perspective of statistic physics and proved with Franz-Parisi
  potential that the solutions are isolated for any finite constraint
  density.
