1. The landscape of deep linear networks has a radically different topology from
   that of deep half-rectified ones, and
2. the energy landscape in the non-linear case is fundamentally controlled by
   the interplay between the smoothness of the data distribution and model
   over-parameterization.

Our main theoretical contribution is to prove that half-rectified single layer
networks are asymptotically connected, and we provide explicit bounds that
reveal the aforementioned interplay.
