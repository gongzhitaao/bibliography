#+KEYWORDS: markov decision process, qlearning

* Gist

Dynamically deactivate some kernels to save computation.

1. model the network pruning as a Markov decision process (MDP),
2. train the decision network by reinforcement learning,
3. redefine the action of pruning to reduce the number of decisions.
