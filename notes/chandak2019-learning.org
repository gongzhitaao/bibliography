#+TITLE: Notes on: Chandak, Y., Theocharous, G., Kostas, J., Jordan, S., & Thomas, P. (2019): Learning action representations for reinforcement learning

* Gist

- Learning an action representation as a /supervised/ learning.
- aligning actions based on the similarity of their *impact on the state*.
- State set may be continuous.
- Action set is finite.
- State to action embedding is stochastic, action embedding to action is
  deterministic.
- Representation is squashed [-1, 1] via =tanh=.
