#+TITLE: Notes on: Brendel, W., & Bethge, M. (2019): Approximating CNNs with bag-of-local-features models works surprisingly well on imagenet

* Gist

** Conclusion

DNNs might be more powerful than previous hand-tuned bag-of-feature algorithms
in discovering weak statistical regularities, but that does not necessarily mean
that they learn substantially different representations.

* Excerpt

- Interpretability :: refers to the way in which evidence from small image
     patches is integrated to reach an image-level decision.
