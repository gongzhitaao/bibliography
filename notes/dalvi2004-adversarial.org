#+TITLE: Notes on: Dalvi, N., Domingos, P., Sanghai, S., Verma, D., & others,  (2004): Adversarial classification

* First Pass

  The authors studied the adversary attack because they wanted to find
  out possible ways to defend against attacks.

* Second Pass

  - We first formalize the problem as a game between a cost-sensitive
    classifier and a cost-sensitive adversary
  - adversary-unaware/aware
