#+TITLE: Notes on: Papernot, N., McDaniel, P., Swami, A., & Harang, R. E. (2016): Crafting adversarial input sequences for recurrent neural networks

* First Pass

  The authors adapt forward gradient and fast sign method to
  adversarial sequences generation and successfully fool RNN
  classifies.
