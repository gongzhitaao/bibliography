#+TITLE: Notes on: Weston, J., Chopra, S., & Bordes, A. (2014): Memory Networks

* First Pass

  The authors studied a novel mechanism, memory network, combining
  inference components with memory components because they want to
  solve the Q&A problem.

* Second Pass

  - I (input) :: word embedding
  - G (generalization) :: simple hash
  - O (output feature map) :: compute score between input and every
       memory, find the memory with highest score.  If more than one
       memory slots is to be supported, the score function takes more
       than one parameter.
  - R (response) :: compute score between each word in dictionary with
       previously select memories and input, return the word with
       highest score.


  The scoring function is an embedding model.

  supervised training.

  Limited verbs and sentence structures.
