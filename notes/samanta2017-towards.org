#+TITLE: Notes on: Samanta, S., & Mehta, S. (2017): Towards Crafting Text Adversarial Samples

* Gist

Our algorithm works best for the datasets which have sub-categories within each
of the classes of examples.

Similar to JSMA, calculate the saliency score for each word, they call it
the /contribution/ for each word.

Crafting the adversarial samples
1. removal of words
2. Addition of words
3. Replacement of words
