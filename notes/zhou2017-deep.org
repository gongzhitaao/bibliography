* Gist

Disadvantage of neural network:
1. data hungry
2. computationally expensive
3. focus only on hyper-parameters tuning
4. elude theoretical analysis

The number of cascade levels can be adaptively determined such that the model
complexity can be automatically set, enabling gcForest to perform excellently
even on small-scale data.

* Comment

1. What about recurrent neural network?  How could you apply gcForest to
   sequential data?
