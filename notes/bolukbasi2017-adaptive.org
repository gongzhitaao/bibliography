#+TITLE: Notes on: Bolukbasi, T., Wang, J., Dekel, O., & Saligrama, V. (2017): Adaptive neural networks for fast test-time prediction

* Gist

We exploit the fact that natural data is typically a mix of easy examples and
difficult examples, and we posit that the easy examples do not require the full
power and complexity of a massive DNN.

After each layer, there is a policy (binary classifier) deciding whether to
proceed to the next layer or exit right now.

Similarly, the author also dynamically choose which network to evaluate.  Simple
examples are evaluated with a smaller network while difficult ones a larger
network.
