#+TITLE: Notes on: Shepard, R. N., & Metzler, J. (1971): Mental rotation of three-dimensional objects

* Gist

** Problem

Observe mental rotation when recognizing objects.

** Conclusion

1. to make the required comparison they first had to imagine one object as
   rotated into the same orientation as the other and that they could carry out
   this /mental rotation/ at no greater than a certain limiting rate
2. since they perceived the two-dimensional pictures as objects in
   three-dimensional space, they could imagine the rotation around whichever
   axis was required with equal ease.
