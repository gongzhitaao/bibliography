#+TITLE: Notes on: Wu, J., Leng, C., Wang, Y., Hu, Q., & Cheng, J. (2015): Quantized convolutional neural networks for mobile devices

* First Pass

  The authors propose framework to quantize CNN, Q-CNN, which achieves
  4-6x speedup and 15-20x compression with accuracy drop less than 1%.

* Second Pass

  We leverage /product quantization/ to implement the efficient inner
  product computation.
