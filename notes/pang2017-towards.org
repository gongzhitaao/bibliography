#+TITLE: Notes on: Pang, T., Du, C., & Zhu, J. (2017): Towards robust detection of adversarial examples

* Gist

By minimizing /reverse cross-entropy/ (RCE), our training procedure encourages
the classifiers to return a high confidence on the true class while a uniform
distribution on false classes for each data point, and further makes the
classifiers map the normal examples to the neighborhood of low-dimensional
manifolds in the final-layer hidden space.
