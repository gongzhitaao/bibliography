#+TITLE: Notes on: Baity-Jesi}, M., Sagun, L., Geiger, M., Spigler, S., Ben Arous, G., Cammarota, C., LeCun, Y., â€¦ (2018): Comparing dynamics: deep neural networks versus glassy systems

* Gist

The existence of different phases depending on whether the network is
under-parameterized or over-parameterized.

The training process of a deep neural network (DNN) shares very strong
similarities with the physical dynamics of /disordered systems/:
1. the loss function plays the role of the energy,
2. the weights are the degrees of freedom, and
3. the dataset corresponds to the parameters defining the energy function.

The randomness in the data is akin to what is called "quenched disorder" in the
physics literature.

Two main observables have been identified as central to characterize the slow
dynamics of physical systems.
1. energy as a function of time
2. two-time correlation function used to investigate the out-of-equilibrium
   dynamics.

Dynamics slows down because of the emergence of flat directions that ultimately
lead to diffusion at or close to the bottom of the landscape.
