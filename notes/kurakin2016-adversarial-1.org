1. Adversarial training provides robustness to FGSM 1-step, but not for multiple
   steps.
2. Adversarial samples from iterative methods are less likely to be transferred
   between networks.
3. Increase of model capacity could help to increase robustness to adversarial
   examples especially when used in conjunction with adversarial training.
