** Local Smoothness

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

p37/57 Second, real data will typically exhibit some smoothness properties (at
least locally) so that for the most part small changes in the input variables
will produce small changes in the target variables, and so we can exploit local
interpolation-like techniques to allow us to make predictions of the target
variables for new values of the input variables.

#+END_QUOTE

For classification problems, adversarial samples shows the contrary.  What about
regression problems?
