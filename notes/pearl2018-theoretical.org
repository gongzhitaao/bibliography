#+TITLE: Notes on: Pearl, J. (2018): Theoretical impediments to machine learning with seven sparks from the causal revolution

* Gist

** Problem

Automated reasoning.
- The current model-free does not and cannot produce strong AI due to lacking of
  reasoning ability.
- Structural causal models (SCM) are promising.

** Seven Pillars

1. Encoding causal assumptions â€“ transparency and testability.
2. Do-calculus and the control of confounding.
3. The algorithmization of counterfactuals.
4. Mediation analysis and the assessment of direct and indirect effects.
5. External validity and sample selection bias.
6. Missing data.
7. Causal discovery.
