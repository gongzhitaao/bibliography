#+TITLE: Notes on: Morcos, A., Raghu, M., & Bengio, S. (2018): Insights on representational similarity in neural networks with canonical correlation

* Gist

Use CCAÂ cite:raghu2017-svcca to compare the similarity of different neural
network.

1. Groups of networks which generalize converge to more similar solutions than
   those which memorize.
2. Wider networks converge to more similar solutions than narrower networks.
3. Networks with identical topology but distinct learning rates converge to a
   small set of diverse solutions.
4. RNNs exhibit bottom-up convergence.  Across sequence timesteps, however, we
   find that RNN representations vary significantly.

** Method

Each neuron has a CCA vector.
- Those that continue to change after network stabilizes are noises.
- Those that stabilize early are the important ones.
