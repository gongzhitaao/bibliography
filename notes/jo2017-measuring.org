#+TITLE: Notes on: Jo}, J., & Bengio, Y. (2017): Measuring the tendency of cnns to learn surface statistical regularities
#+KEYWORDS: fft, superficial cues, statistical regularity

* Gist

Thus we provide quantitative evidence supporting the hypothesis that deep CNNs
tend to learn surface statistical regularities in the dataset rather than
higher-level abstract concepts.

The current incarnation of deep neural networks exhibit a tendency to learn
*surface statistical regularities* as opposed to *higher level abstractions* in
the dataset.  For tasks such as object recognition, due to the strong
statistical properties of natural images, these superficial cues that the deep
neural network have learned are sufficient for high performance generalization,
but in a narrow distributional sense.
