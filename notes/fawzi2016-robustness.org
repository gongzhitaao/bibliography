#+TITLE: Notes on: Fawzi, A., Moosavi-Dezfooli, S., & Frossard, P. (2016): Robustness of classifiers: from adversarial to random noise

* Gist

To improve the robustness to semi-random noise, our analysis encourages to
impose geometric constraints on the curvature of the decision boundary, as we
have shown the existence of an intimate relation between the robustness of
classifiers and the curvature of the decision boundary.
