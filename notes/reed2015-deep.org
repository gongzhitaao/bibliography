#+TITLE: Notes on: Reed, S. E., Zhang, Y., Zhang, Y., & Lee, H. (2015): Deep visual analogy-making

* Gist

** Problem

(A, B; C, D?): A is to B as C is to D.  D is unknown, the goal is to infer D by
transforming C by apply the transformation A to B.

* Note

** The Big Picture

We denote a valid /analogy/ as a 4-tuple ~A:B::C:D~, often spoken as ~A~ is to ~B~ as ~C~
is to ~D~.  Given such an analogy, there are several questions one might ask:
- ~A?B::C?D~ What is the common relationship?
- ~A:B?C:D~ Are ~A~ and ~B~ related in the same way that ~C~ and ~D~ are related?
- ~A:B::C:?~ What is the result of applying the transformation ~A:B~ to ~C~?

** Idea

The model needs to remember the objects internally.  Can we separate the memory
from the attribute?
