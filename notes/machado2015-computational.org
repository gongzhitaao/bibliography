#+TITLE: Notes on: Machado, E. L., Miosso, C. J., von Borries, R., Coutinho, M., Berger, P. d. A., Marques, T., & Jacobi, R. P. (2015): Computational cost reduction in learned transform classifications

* First Pass

  The authors propose several techniques to reduce computation in
  Learning Algorithm for Soft-Thresholding classifier (LAST).

  /Note/: I do not think this paper is well organized, nor convincing.
