#+TITLE: Notes on: Veit, A., Belongie, S., & Karaletsos, T. (2016): Disentangling Nonlinear Perceptual Embeddings With Multi-Query Triplet Networks

* First Pass

  The authors studied similarity based learning problem and proposed
  multi-query triplet network (MQN) because they want to build a
  single system to classify objects based on different criteria.

* Second Pass

  - Goal is to classify objects according to different criteria.
    E.g., green square, red square, red circle.  Color-wise, last two
    fall in the same category, which shale-wise, the first two fall in
    the same category.
  - In future work, it would be interesting to generalize our work and
    consider the setting of learning from unlabeled triplets by
    introducing a clustering mechanism for triplets and masks in order
    to discover similarity substructures in an unsupervised way.
