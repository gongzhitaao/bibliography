#+TITLE: Notes on: Xie, C., Wang, J., Zhang, Z., Ren, Z., & Yuille, A. L. (2017): Mitigating Adversarial Effects Through Randomization

* Gist

** Problem

Defend against adversarial images by randomly resizing (a little bit) and
padding the input image.

** Evaluation

*** Datasets

- 5k images from ImageNet.

*** Models

- Inception v3
- ResNet v2
- Inception-ResNet v2

** Method

Randomly resize (a small amount) and pad an input image before feeding it into
the classifier.

* Note

Why One-pixel padding/resizing is effective?  What does the network learn?
