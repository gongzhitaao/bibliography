#+TITLE: Notes on: Kawaguchi}, K., & Bengio, Y. (2018): Generalization in machine learning via analytical learning theory

analytical (measure-theoretic) learning theory vs statistical learning theory

- the star-discrepancy evaluates how well a dataset captures a normalized
  measure.
- variation in the sense of Hardy and Krause computes how a function varies in
  total w.r.t. each small perturbation of every cross combination of its
  variables.
