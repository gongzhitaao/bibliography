#+TITLE: Notes on: Biggio, B., Nelson, B., & Laskov, P. (2011): Support Vector Machines Under Adversarial Label Noise.

Our model is based on a simple assumption that any label may be
flipped with a fixed probability.

We show that this noise can be compensated for by correcting the
kernel matrix of SVM with a specially structured matrix, which depends
on the noise parameters of our model.
