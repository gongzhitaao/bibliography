#+TITLE: Notes on: Suwajanakorn, S., Snavely, N., Tompson, J. J., & Norouzi, M. (2018): Discovery of latent 3d keypoints via end-to-end geometric reasoning

* Gist

** Problem

Predict key points for objects in 2D images.

** Evaluation

*** Datasets

- ShapeNet cite:chang2015-shapenet

** Method

Loss composes multiple parts.
- Multiple view consistency.  Difference of coordinates of corresponding key
  points in 2D images of two different views.  This loss alone will result in
  all points in one place.
- Misfit between estimation relative rotation via
  Procrustes cite:schoenemann1966-generalized.

- Translation /equivariance/ :: key points coordinate is described by a
     probability distribution over all pixels where the expected value is the
     predicted coordinate.
- Break symmetry :: a separate binary network predicts the coarse orientation,
     i.e., face left or right.
- Separation loss :: no two key points should be together.
- Silhouette consistency :: all points should lie within the objects, accessing
     a binary mask during training.

* Notes

- The key points are not always related to the
  vertices cite:biederman1987-recognition
- Does not perform well on real image, e.g., ImageNet.
