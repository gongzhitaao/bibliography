#+TITLE: Notes on: Ioffe, S., & Szegedy, C. (2015): Batch normalization: accelerating deep network training by reducing internal covariate shift

When the input distribution to a learning system changes, it is said
to experience covariate shift cite:shimodaira2000.

If, however, we could ensure that the distribution of nonlinearity
inputs remains more stable as the network trains, then the optimizer
would be less likely to get stuck in the saturated regime, and the
training would accelerate.

- Internal Covariate Shift :: is the change in the distribution of
     network activations due to the change in network parameters
     during training.
