Cost function consists of two parts:
1. ordinary training error,
2. plus some measure of the network complexity.

model complexity, vapnik-chervonenkis dimensionality, description
length, number of non-zero free parameters,

Remove parameters with small saliency.

magnitude as saliency,

OBD uses second derivative of the objective function w.r.t the
parameters to compute the saliencies.

Justification for using Hessian values as saliency measure.

\[\delta E = \sum_i g_i\delta w_i + \frac{1}{2}\sum_i h_i\delta w_i^2 + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i\neq j} h_{ij}\delta w_i \delta w_j + O(||\delta W||^3)\]

1. At local minimum, first term vanishes.
2. Ignore third term and higher order term for simplicity.

Thus the above reduces to the following, which is the saliency score.

\[\delta E = \frac{1}{2}\sum_i h_i\delta w_i^2\]
