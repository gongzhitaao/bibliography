* Gist

** Problem

Compress and (possibly) speedup the network by approximating weight matrix with
a series of scaled binary matrix.

** Evaluation

*** Datasets

- ImageNet

*** Metrics

- Accuracy
- Parameter size
- number of float multiplication (FMUL) and addition (FADD)
- Energy cost cite:zhang2015-efficient

*** Comparison

- XNOR-net cite:rastegari2016-xnor
- Binary-Connect cite:courbariaux2015-binaryconnect

** Method

Approximate \(W\) with the following

\[W\prime = \sum_i^m a_i B_i\]

\(a_i\) is a float scalar, \(B_i\) a binary matrix with only +1/-1.  And
*minimize* \(\|W-W\prime\|_2\).

Directly solving the above optimization is NP-hard.  Instead, iteratively
minimize the residue, similar to the cascade network training idea.
