#+TITLE: Notes on: Fetaya}, E., Jacobsen, J\"orn-Henrik, & Zemel, Richard (2019): Conditional Generative Models Are Not Robust

* Gist

Propose that non-robustness (e.g., adversarial examples, failure to detect
outliers) is due to the likelihood-based density modeling.

#+begin_quote
We conclude that likelihood-based density modeling and robust classification may
fundamentally be at odds with one another as important aspects of the problem
are not captured by this training and evaluation metric.
