#+TITLE: Notes on: Chaudhari, P., Choromanska, A., Soatto, S., & LeCun, Y. (2016): Entropy-sgd: biasing gradient descent into wide valleys

* Gist

local entropy

Energy landscape near a local minimum discovered by SGD is almost flat
for a wide variety of deep networks irrespective of their
architecture, input data or training methods.

Bias the optimization towards flat regions that have low
generalization error (low local entropy).

* Summary

Prefer local minima that have flat areas locally which generalize well.
