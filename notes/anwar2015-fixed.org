#+TITLE: Notes on: Anwar, S., Hwang, K., & Sung, W. (2015): Fixed point optimization of deep convolutional neural networks for object recognition

* First Pass

  The authors quantize CNN weights in a layer by layer fashion via
  Lloyd-Max quantization method.  The quantization induces sparsity,
  thus improving the generalization.
