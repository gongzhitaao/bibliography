We introduce a novel approach to predict both technical and aesthetic qualities
of images.

We use the squared EMD (earth moverâ€™s distance) loss, which shows a performance
boost in classification with ordered classes.

In training, input images are re-scaled to 256x256, and then a crop of size
224x224 crop is randomly extracted.  This lessens potential over-fitting issues,
especially when training on relatively small datasets.

Another random data augmentation in our training process is horizontal flipping
of the image crops.
