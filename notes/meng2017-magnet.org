#+TITLE: Notes on: Meng, D., & Chen, H. (2017): Magnet: a two-pronged defense against adversarial examples

* Gist

MagNet learns to differentiate between normal and adversarial examples by
approximating the manifold of normal examples.

Basically use autoencoder.

Detector based on
1. reconstruction error,
2. Jensen-Shannon divergence.

Remove adversarial noise:
1. add Gaussian noise
2. de-noise autoencoder
