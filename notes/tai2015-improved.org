#+TITLE: Notes on: Tai, K. S., Socher, R., & Manning, C. D. (2015): Improved Semantic Representations From Tree-Structured Long Short-Term Memory Networks

* Gist

** Problem

Propose tree-LSTM for tree structured networks.

** Evaluation

*** Datasets

- sentiment, Sanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) cite:socher2013-recursive
- semantic relatedness, Sentences Involving Compositional Knowledge
  (SICK) cite:marelli2014-sick

*** Metrics

- Pearson’s
- Spearman’s
- MSE

** Method

1. The input sentence is parsed (with separate tools, e.g., a parser) into a
   dependency or a constituency tree
2. The tree is traversed in a DFS-fashion by the LSTM node.

Since the input has to be fixed size,
1. if branching factor is high, the hidden states from the children are summed.
2. if we have N children, then each child's hidden state may be associated with
   a trainable weight matrix.

* Thoughts

- Interesting
- Is the extra effort worth it?  Only minor, if not negligible, improvement.
