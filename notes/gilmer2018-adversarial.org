#+TITLE: Notes on: Gilmer}, J., Metz, L., Faghri, F., Schoenholz, S.~S., Raghu, M., Wattenberg, M., & Goodfellow, I. (2018): Adversarial Spheres

* Gist

** Problem

Understand adversarial examples: for this dataset we show a fundamental
trade-off between /the amount of test error/ and /the average distance to
nearest error/.

** Evaluation

*** Datasets

- Synthesized concentric spheres
  - dynamically sample from the distribution
  - fixed training set.

*** Metrics

Accuracy

** Method

Obtain a theoretical boundary based on a simpler model trained on a simple
synthesized dataset, i.e., the quadratic network on concentric spheres.
