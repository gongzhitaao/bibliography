Neuroscience supports AI development, examples:
1. Attention mechanism.
2. Episodic Memory.  Replay buffer in DQN, adapts quickly to learning samples.
3. Working Memory.  LSTM, differential neural computer (DNC).  DNC can solve
   shortest path on graph-like structure, manipulating blocks in a variant of
   the Tower of Hanoi task.
4. Continual Learning.  Elastic weight consolidation (EWC).

The relevance of neuroscience, both as a roadmap for the AI research agenda and
as a source of computational tools is particularly salient in the following key
areas.
1. intuitive understanding of the physical world.
2. Efficient learning.  "Characters challenge", one-shot concept learning,
   learning to learn.
3. Transfer learning.  Progressive network.  Neural coding.
4. Imagination and planning.
5. Virtual brain analysis.
