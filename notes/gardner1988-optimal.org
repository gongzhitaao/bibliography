#+TITLE: Notes on: Gardner, E., & Derrida, B. (1988): Optimal storage properties of neural network models

* Gist

Given \(p\) spin configurations (which we call patterns),
\(\{S_i^\mu\}\) for \(1\leq i\leq N\) and \(1\leq \mu \leq p\) , what
is the probability that randomly chosen interactions \(J_{ij}\), have
these patterns as metastable states?

This question is an important one in the theory of neural networks
where one usually represents the patterns one wants to store by spin
configurations \(\{S_i^\mu\}\) and the synapses by pair interactions,
J_{ij}.
