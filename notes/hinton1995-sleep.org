#+TITLE: Notes on: Hinton, G., Dayan, P., Frey, B., & Neal, R. (1995): The "wake-sleep" algorithm for unsupervised neural networks

* First Pass

  The authors propose a novel unsupervised learning method for neural
  network which combines recognition (wake phase) and generation
  (sleep phase) to force the network to learn economical
  representations that capture the underlying regularities in the
  data.
