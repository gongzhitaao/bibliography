#+TITLE: Notes on: Radford, A., Rafal J\'ozefowicz, & Sutskever, I. (2017): Learning to generate reviews and discovering sentiment

* Gist

By inspecting the relative contributions of features on various datasets, we
discovered a single unit within the mLSTM that directly corresponds to
sentiment.

We also demonstrate the sentiment unit has a direct influence on the generative
process of the model.  Simply fixing its value to be positive or negative
generates samples with the corresponding positive or negative sentiment.

But some of the classification tasks they are evaluated on, such as sentiment
analysis of reviews of consumer goods, do not have much overlap with the text of
novels.
