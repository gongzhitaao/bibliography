#+TITLE: Notes on: Vahdat, A. (2017): Toward robustness against label noise in training deep discriminative neural networks

* Gist

This paper tackles the problem of training deep CNNs for the image labeling task
from data points with noisy labels.

We propose a conditional random field (CRF) model to represent the relationship
between noisy and clean labels, and we show how modern deep CNNs can gain
robustness against label noise using our proposed structure.  We model the clean
labels as latent variables during training, and we design our structure such
that the latent variables can be inferred efficiently.

The main *challenge* in modeling clean labels as latent is the /lack of
semantics/ on latent variables.
