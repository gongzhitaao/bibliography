#+TITLE: Notes on: Joulin, A., Grave, E., Bojanowski, P., & Mikolov, T. (2016): Bag of Tricks for Efficient Text Classification

* Summary

  Our approach does not require sophisticated inference at test time,
  making its learned representations easily reusable on different
  problems.

* Problem

  We evaluate the quality of our model on two different tasks, namely
  *tag prediction* and *sentiment analysis*.
