#+TITLE: Notes on: Rastegari, M., Ordonez, V., Redmon, J., & Farhadi, A. (2016): Xnor-net: imagenet classification using binary convolutional neural networks

* First Pass

  The authors propose yet another binarized convolution networks and
  XNOR-networks which achieves same accuracy as AlexNet on ImageNet.
  And it outperforms recent binary network.  In addition it could run
  on CPU efficiently.

* Second Pass

  minimize L2 loss between the original weight \(W\) and binary filter
  \(B\) with a scaling factor \(\alpha\).

  1. Binary network

     binary weights, addition and subtraction

  2. XNOR network

     binary weights and input, XNOR operation
