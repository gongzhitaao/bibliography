#+TITLE: Notes on: Nguyen, A., Yosinski, J., & Clune, J. (2016): Multifaceted feature visualization: uncovering the different types of features learned by each neuron in deep neural networks

* Contribution

  1. Improves the state of the art of activation maximization by
     producing higher quality images with more global structure,
     details, context, more natural colors, and
  2. shows the multiple feature facets each neuron detects, which
     provides a more comprehensive understanding of each neuron's
     function.
  3. Proposes *center-biased regularization* technique, which reduces
     optimization's tendency to produce repeated object fragments and
     instead tends to produce one central object.

* Future Work

  Automatically identifying the true number of facets is an important,
  open scientific question raised, but not answered, by this paper.
