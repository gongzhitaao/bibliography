#+TITLE: Notes on: Tachet des Combes}, R., Pezeshki, M., Shabanian, S., Courville, A., & Bengio, Y. (2018): On the learning dynamics of deep neural networks

* Gist

** Problem

Explore the learning dynamics of neural nets.

** Conclusion

1. *Independent mode learning*.  Learning happens independently between
   different classes, i.e. classes induce a partition of the network
   activations, corresponding to orthogonal modes of the data.
