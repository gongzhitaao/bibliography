#+TITLE: Notes on: Layek, G. (2015): An introduction to dynamical systems and chaos

* Gist

** Chapter 1

The mathematical deﬁnition of stability, construction of *Lyapunov function*,
and *Lyapunov theorem* are extensively used for analyzing the stability of a
particular class of systems.  Also, *Lyapunov exponent*, assuming the
exponential growth/decay with time of nearby orbits are applied for quantifying
in chaotic motions.

In qualitative analysis we mainly look for the following solution behaviors:
1. Local stability of ﬁxed points for a system;
2. Analyzing the existence of periodic/quasi-periodic solutions, limit cycle,
   relaxation oscillation, hysteresis, etc.
3. Local and asymptotic solution behaviors of a system;
4. Topological features of flows such as bifurcations, catastrophe, topological
   equivalence, transitiveness, etc.
