#+TITLE: Notes on: Baldassi, C., Ingrosso, A., Lucibello, C., Saglietti, L., & Zecchina, R. (2015): Subdominant dense clusters allow for simple learning and high computational performance in neural networks with discrete synapses

* First Pass

  The authors propose methods to prove the existence of dense
  subdominant solution regions for network with discrete connections
  which was shown being exponentially dominated by isolated solutions
  that are extremely hard to find algorithmically.

* Second Pass

  Biological considerations and recent experimental evidence
  cite:oconnor2005-graded,oconnor2005-graded suggest that synaptic
  efficacies store a few bits each (between 1 and 5)

  The optimal synaptic configurations are typically geometrically
  isolated (i.e., they have mutual Hamming distances of order N), and
  thus are even harder to find for local search strategies.
