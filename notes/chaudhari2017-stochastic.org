#+TITLE: Notes on: Chaudhari}, P., & Soatto, S. (2017): Stochastic gradient descent performs variational inference, converges to limit cycles for deep networks

* Gist

SGD minimizes an average potential over the posterior distribution of weights
along with an entropic regularization term.

The most likely locations of SGD are not the local minima, nor the saddle
points, of the original loss.
