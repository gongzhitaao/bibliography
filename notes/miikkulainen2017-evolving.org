* Gist

- how to design the components of the architecture,
- how to put them together into a full network topology, and
- how to set the hyperparameters for the components and the global
  design

- Fitness :: The fitness of the evolved networks is determined based
     on how well they can be trained.  During each generation, each
     network is trained for a few epochs before being evaluated on the
     validation set, the result of which is used as the fitness value.

This network utilizes the same modules multiple times, resulting in a
*deep* and *repetitive* structure typical of many successful DNNs.
