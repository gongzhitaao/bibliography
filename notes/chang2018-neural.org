Von Neumann argued that a non-trivial self-replicator necessarily includes three
components that by themselves do not suffice to be self-replicators:
1. a description of the replicator,
2. a copying mechanism that can clone descriptions, and
3. a mechanism that can embed the copying mechanism within the replicator
   itself.
