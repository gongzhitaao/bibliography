#+TITLE: Notes on: Pathak}, J., Lu, Z., Hunt, B.~R., Girvan, M., & Ott, E. (2017): Using machine learning to replicate chaotic attractors and calculate lyapunov exponents from data

* Gist

Dataset:
1. the Lorenz system, and
2. the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation.

* Comment

Time-series prediction with reservoir computing model.  The input data is from
chaos systems.

If we use LSTM, would it be better?
