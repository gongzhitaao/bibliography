- Learning to rank approach
  - Point-wise approach :: regards a single document as its input in learning
       and defines its loss function based on individual documents.
    - regression based
    - classification based
    - ordinal regression based
    Some refs in this category:

  - Pairwise approach :: takes document pairs as instances in learning, and
       formalizes the problem of learning to rank as that of pairwise
       classification.  Some work in this category:
    - cite:burges2005-learning
    - cite:freund2003-efficient
  - List-wise approach :: takes document lists as instances in learning and the
       loss function is defined on that basis.
    - cite:cao2007-learning
- non-learning approach

In learning to rank, each /query-document pair/ is represented by a
/multi-dimensional feature vector/, and each dimension of the vector is a
feature indicating how relevant or important the document is with respect to the
query.

* Comment

- Are the documents associated with test queries seen during training or held
  out?
