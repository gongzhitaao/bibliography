#+TITLE: Notes on: Toderici, G., Vincent, D., Johnston, N., Hwang, S.~J., Minnen, D., Shor, J., & Covell, M. (2016): Full Resolution Image Compression with Recurrent Neural Networks

* First Pass

  The authors studied image compression with recurrent neural network.

* Second Pass

  Solution to image of arbitrary size:
  1) design a stronger patch-based residual encoder; and
  2) design an entropy coder that is able to capture long-term
     dependencies between patches in the image.


  Evaluation metrics
  1. PSNR-HVS
  2. MS-SSIM


  Most image compression neural networks use a /fixed compression
  rate/ based on the size of a bottleneck layer.  This work extends
  previous methods by supporting /variable rate compression/ while
  maintaining high compression rates beyond thumbnail-sized images.

  Encoder -> Binarizer -> Decoder

  Reconstruction
  1. One-shot Reconstruction
  2. Additive Reconstruction
  3. Residual Scaling
