#+TITLE: Notes on: Sun, K., Wang, J., Kalousis, A., & Marchand-Maillet, S. (2015): Space-Time Local Embeddings

* Problem

  Dimension reduction

* Method

  Use semi-Riemannian space-time instead of Euclidean space, i.e., it
  uses as dissimilarity measure /interval/ instead of Euclidean
  distance.

  An optimal embedding can be obtained by minimizing the KL divergence
  from the input p to the output p(Y).

* TODO Implementation

  Have not figured out yet.  I do not fully understand the procedure
  of mapping a n-dimensional Euclidean space to (s + t)-dimensional
  semi-Riemannian space.

* Experiment

  Compared with SNE and t-SNE.
