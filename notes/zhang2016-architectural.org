#+TITLE: Notes on: Zhang, S., Wu, Y., Che, T., Lin, Z., Memisevic, R., Salakhutdinov, R., & Bengio, Y. (2016): Architectural Complexity Measures of Recurrent Neural Networks

* First Pass

  The authors studied different RNN complexity measurements in order
  to understand the factors that influence RNN performance because
  they want to explore more novel architectures.

* Second Pass

  Three criteria:
  - recurrent depth :: captures the RNN over-time nonlinear complexity
  - feedforward depth :: captures the local input-output nonlinearity
  - recurrent skip coefficient :: captures how rapidly the information
       propagates over time.
