Convolutional pooling architectures can be inherently frequency selective and
translation invariant, even when initialized with random weights.

We suggest distinguishing the contributions of architectures from those of
learning systems by reporting random weight performance.

1. Search architectures initialized with random weights.
2. Fine-tune those architectures that perform well with random weights.
