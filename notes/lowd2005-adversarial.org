#+TITLE: Notes on: Lowd, D., & Meek, C. (2005): Adversarial learning

* Gist

** Problem

Adversarial classifier reverse engineering (ACRE) learning problem, the task of
learning sufficient information about a classifier to construct adversarial
attacks.

** Evaluation

*** Datasets

- Private, consists of 500,000 Hotmail messages, voluntarily hand-labeled by the
  original recipients as /spam/ or /legitimate/.  From these, we extracted
  ~290,000 Boolean features.

*** Metrics

- Adversarial cost, a linear function, defined as the weighted absolute
  difference between feature values in the base instance, \(x^a\) , and those in
  the target instance, \(x\).  The base instance is one randomly chosen from the
  test set.

** Method

Change words in a spam email in the order of determined by the importance score
to
1. bypass the spam filter, while
2. minimize the adversarial cost.

The spam filter is a linear classifier (/naive Bayesian/ and /maximum entropy
model/).
