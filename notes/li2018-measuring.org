#+TITLE: Notes on: Li, C., Farkhoor, H., Liu, R., & Yosinski, J. (2018): Measuring the intrinsic dimension of objective landscapes

* Gist

** Problem

Finding the dimension of the subspace needed to solve a problem with neural
network.

** Evaluation

*** Datasets

- MNIST
- CIFAR-10
- ImageNet

*** Metrics

- Accuracy, 90% of the baseline accuracy.  Since achieving 100% of the baseline
  accuracy requires almost exact the same dimension.

** Method

\[\theta^{(D)} = \theta^{(D)}_0 + P\theta^{(d)} \]

1. \(\theta^{(D)}_0\) is randomly initialized and fixed.
2. \(P\) is a (D, d) matrix, random initialized and fixed.

* Note

- On MNIST with  random pixels:
  - FC intrinsic dimension does not change
  - CNN's becomes larger, which shows that CNN uses local structure information
    for the final prediction.
- We may need exponentially more parameters to push the boost accuracy.

* Future Work

Main drawback is that we need to retrain the whole network multiple times.
