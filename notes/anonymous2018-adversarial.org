* Gist

- *Semantic similarity* is measured in terms of *thought vectors*
  cite:bengio2003-neural,mikolov2013-efficient, which are computed as the
  average of the vectors for individual words.
- *Syntactic similarity* is calculated from a language model trained on the same
  dataset.

Black-box attack on three models
1. Naive Bayes
2. LSTM
3. Word-level CNN cite:kim2014-convolutional
4. Character-level CNN cite:conneau2016-very
