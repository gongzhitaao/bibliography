#+TITLE: Notes on: Chen, T. (2014): Introduction to boosted trees

* Notes

  - Most heuristics maps well to objectives, taking the formal
    - information gain -> training loss
    - pruning -> regularization defined by #node
    - max depth -> constraint on the function space
    - smoothing leaf values -> L2 regularization on leaf weights
